Description

cancel cancels existing print jobs. The -a option will remove all jobs from the specified destination.  

Options
The following options are recognized by lp:

-E

Forces encryption when connecting to the server.

-c

This option is provided for backwards-compatibility only. On systems that support it, this option forces the print file to be copied to the spool directory before printing. In CUPS, print files are always sent to the scheduler via IPP which has the same effect.

-d destination

Prints files to the named printer.

-h hostname

Specifies the print server hostname. The default is "localhost" or the value of the CUPS_SERVER environment variable.

-i job-id

Specifies an existing job to modify.

-m

Send email when the job is completed (not supported CUPS 1.1.)

-n copies

Sets the number of copies to print from 1 to 100.

-o option

Sets a job option.

-q priority

Sets the job priority from 1 (lowest) to 100 (highest). The default priority is 50.

-s

Do not report the resulting job IDs (silent mode.)

-t name

Sets the job name.

-H handling

Specifies when the job should be printed. A value of immediate will print the file immediately, a value of hold will hold the job indefinitely, and a time value (HH:MM) will hold the job until the specified time.

Use a value of resume with the -i option to resume a held job.

-P page-list

Specifies which pages to print in the document. The list can contain a list of numbers and ranges (#-#) separated by commas (e.g. 1,3-5,16).
