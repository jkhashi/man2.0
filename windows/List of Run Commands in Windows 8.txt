List of Run Commands in Windows 8

A Windows 8 run command is simply the name of the file used to execute a program. Knowing the run command for a program in Windows 8 can be useful if you'd like to start a program from a script file or if you only have access to a command line interface during a Windows issue.

For example, write.exe is the file name for the WordPad program in Windows 8. By executing the write run command, you can start the WordPad program.

Did I Miss a Windows 8 Run Command? Please let me know and I'll add it, but make sure it's a true run command, not a Command Prompt command or a Control Panel "command" that some other lists I've seen sometimes include.

You can see those in my Command Prompt Commands in Windows 8 and Control Panel Command Line Commands lists.

[1] The netproj run command is only available in Windows 8 if Network Projection is enabled from Windows Features.

[2] The fontview run command must be followed with the name of the font that you want to see.

[3] This run command can not be executed from the Command Prompt because the file is not in the default Windows path. However, it can be run from other areas in Windows 8 that allow execution of files when typed, like Run and Search.

[4] The regedt32 run command forwards to regedit and executes it instead.

[5] This run command is not available in 64-bit versions of Windows 8.
