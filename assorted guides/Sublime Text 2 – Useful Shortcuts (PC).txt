Ctrl+C, Ctrl+X and Ctrl+V let you copy/cut/paste lines if you don't select anything. So, Ctrl+X doesn't "delete" a line, it cuts it. To delete a line, the default shortcut is Ctrl+Shift+K :)

Highlighting a bunch of lines then hitting Cmd (Ctrl?) +Shift+L gives you multi-cursors on each line. I do that, followed by Cmd + Right arrow (End?) to get easily get a cursor at the end of a series of lines to simultaneously type something after each.

@losvedir I've figured out that it's Ctrl+L repeated, followed by Ctrl+⇧+L, then finally → to get to the end. Now you have the cursor at the end of multiple lines. Thanks for sharing!

Alt + F3 select all occurrences of current word for multiple editing. Very useful.
